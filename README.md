> Harnessing the Power of the wavefunctions to navigate the quantum realm.üöÄüåå

This project presents an optimized approach for calculating the position wave functions of a Fock state of a quantum harmonic oscillator, with applications in Photonic Quantum Computing simulations. Leveraging [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)  [[1](#-references)] and [Cython](https://cython.org/) [[2](#-references)], this approach outperforms the [Mr Mustard](https://mrmustard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package [[3, 4](#-references)] in computing a single wave function value at a single position and at multiple positions.

## ‚ú® Advantages


- **Highly Efficient**: This package includes two fixed-point modules focused on speed. One is implemented using *Numba*, an open-source Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler, and the other module is implemented in *Cython*, a programming language that combines the ease of use of Python with the speed of C.
- **Highly Accurate**: The functions in this package have precision next to the precision of Wolfram Mathematica and MATLAB. In addition, there is a module for calculating wave functions with arbitrary precision using the *mpmath* package.
- **Past response cache**: This package provides a caching module designed to enhance the performance of functions that take multiple positions of a *NumPy* array as input. This module stores previously computed results by leveraging Python's functools.lru_cache, eliminating the need for redundant calculations. This caching module is inspired by the [caching module](https://github.com/XanaduAI/MrMustard/blob/develop/mrmustard/math/caching.py#L26) from Mr. Mustard, a package from the photonic quantum computing company Xanadu.

## üåä The Wavefunction

The wavefunction, $\Psi(x,t)$, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the quantum state of a particle or system. Its absolute square, $|\Psi(x,t)|^2$, represents the probability density of finding the particle at position $\mathbf{x}$ and time $\mathbf{t}$. Due to the normalization property: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\Psi(x,t)|^2 dx = 1$ it's guaranteed that for a given time $\mathbf{t}$, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space is unity [[5](#-references)].

###  Schr√∂dinger Equation

The wavefunction is the solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation, a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics:

$$
-\Bigg(\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\Bigg)\frac{\partial^2 \Psi(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}} + \Bigg(\frac{m\omega^2 x^2}{2}\Bigg)\Psi(x,t) = \mathbf{i}\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi(x,t)}{\partial t} \quad \mathbf{(1)}
$$

where $\mathbf{\hbar}$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\mathbf{m}$ is the mass of the particle, and $\mathbf{\omega}$ is the angular frequency of the harmonic potential. The symbol $\mathbf{i}$ represents the imaginary unit. When seeking the solution to this equation, we separated the variables as follows: $\Psi(x,t) = \psi(x)f(t)$, and we find as a result for $f(t)$ [[5](#-references)]:

$$ f(t) = Ce^{-iEt/\hbar} \quad \mathbf{(2)}$$

where $\mathbf{C}$ may be considered an arbitrary complex constant and $\mathbf{E}$, the system separation constant can be interpreted as the system's energy. Substituting into the wavefunction we have [[5](#-references)]:

$$ \Psi(x,t) = Ce^{-iEt/\hbar}\psi(x) \quad \mathbf{(3)}$$

The term $e^{-\frac{iE}{\hbar}t}$ is called the **phase factor** of $\Psi(x,t)$. In order to find $\psi(x)$ we then solve the time-independent Schr√∂ndiger equation [[5](#-references)]:

$$
-\Bigg(\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\Bigg)\psi''(x) + \Bigg(\frac{m\omega^2 x^2}{2}\Bigg)\psi(x) = E\psi(x) \quad \mathbf{(4)}
$$


### Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

By solving equation **(4)**, we obtain a family of energy eigenfunctions defined as follows [[5](#-references)]:

$$
\psi_n(x) = \left(\frac{m\omega}{\pi\hbar}\right)^{1/4} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n n!}} H_n\left(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}}x\right) e^{-m\omega x^2/2\hbar} , \quad  n \in \mathbb{N}_{0} \quad \mathbf{(3)}
$$

where $\mathbf{n}$ represents a non-negative integer corresponding to the different energy states of the system, with energies given by $E_n = \big(n + \frac{1}{2}\big)\hbar \omega$. The term $\mathbf{H_n}$ denotes the Hermite polynomial of degree $\mathbf{n}$; thus, for each energy state $\mathbf{n}$, there is an associated Hermite polynomial of degree $\mathbf{n}$ within its eigenfunction [[5](#-references)]:

</div>

<br>

The energy eigenfunction for an energy state $\mathbf{n}$ is the wavefunction for an energy state $\mathbf{n}$ of a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator. From this definition, we can then represent the wave function $\Psi(x,t)$ as a series expansion of its family of energy eigenfunctions $\{\psi_{n}(x)\}$ [[5](#-references)]:

$$
\Psi(x,t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{n}\psi_{n}(x)e^{-\mathbf{i}E_{n}t/\hbar} \quad \mathbf{(4)}
$$

In this equation, $\mathbf{c_{n}}$ are complex constants that determine the contribution of each eigenfunction $\psi_{n}$ to the total wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$. These coefficients are chosen to ensure that the wavefunction satisfies the initial condition of the problem ($t=0$) [[5](#-references)].

## üîÅ The Wavefunction Recurrence

In essence, Mr Mustard's strategy is to use the [Renormalized Hermite Polynomial](https://mrmustard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/mrmustard.math.hermite_renormalized.html) [[3, 4](#-references)] for the computation of the wavefunction of a quantum harmonic oscillator. Below, we show the recurrence for calculating the Renormalized Hermite Polynomial, as well as the method for calculating it using the traditional Hermite polynomial:

$$H_{n+1}^{re}(x) = \displaystyle\frac{2}{\sqrt{n+1}}\bigg[xH_{n}^{\; re}(x) - H_{n-1}^{\; re}(x)\sqrt{n-1}\bigg] \quad \mathbf{(4)} $$ 

$$H_{n}^{re}(x) = \displaystyle\frac{H_{n}(x)}{\sqrt{n!}} \quad \mathbf{(5)} $$ 

When we use this polynomial in calculating the wavefunction of a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, the equation is as follows:

$$\psi_{n}(x) = \displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}H_{n}^{\; re}(x)e^{-\frac{x^{2}}{2}} \quad \mathbf{(6)} $$ 

In this package, we implemented a recurrence based on the recursive solution to the wavefunction of the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator presented in the work of *Jos√© Maria P√©rez-Jord√°* [[8](#-references)]. The recurrence we implemented was for $\psi_{n+1}$, which we obtained from the recursive definition of the Hermite polynomial [[9](#-references)], as suggested by *Jos√© Maria P√©rez-Jord√°* in his article:


$H_{n+1}(x) = 2xH_{n}(x) - 2nH_{n-1}(x) \implies $


$\Bigg( \displaystyle\frac{e^{-x^{2}/2}}{\sqrt{2^{n-1}(n-1)!\pi^{1/2}}}\Bigg)H_{n+1}(x) = \Bigg( \displaystyle\frac{e^{-x^{2}/2}}{\sqrt{2^{n-1}(n-1)!\pi^{1/2}}}\Bigg)2xH_{n}(x) -\Bigg( \displaystyle\frac{e^{-x^{2}/2}}{\sqrt{2^{n-1}(n-1)!\pi^{1/2}}}\Bigg)2nH_{n-1}(x) \implies$


$\Bigg( \displaystyle\frac{e^{-x^{2}/2}}{\sqrt{2^{n-1}(n-1)!\pi^{1/2}}}\Bigg)H_{n+1}(x) = \Bigg( \displaystyle\frac{e^{-x^{2}/2}}{\sqrt{2^{n-1}(n-1)!\pi^{1/2}}}\Bigg)2xH_{n}(x) -2n\psi_{n-1}(x) \implies $


$\displaystyle\Bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2n}}\Bigg)\Bigg( \displaystyle\frac{e^{-x^{2}/2}}{\sqrt{2^{n-1}(n-1)!\pi^{1/2}}}\Bigg)H_{n+1}(x) = \Bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2n}}\Bigg)\Bigg( \displaystyle\frac{e^{-x^{2}/2}}{\sqrt{2^{n-1}(n-1)!\pi^{1/2}}}\Bigg)2xH_{n}(x) -\Bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2n}}\Bigg)2n\psi_{n-1}(x) \implies$


$\Bigg(\displaystyle\frac{e^{-x^{2}/2}}{\sqrt{2^{n}n!\pi^{1/2}}}\Bigg) H_{n+1}(x) = 2x\psi_{n}(x) - \Bigg(\frac{2n}{\sqrt{2n}}\Bigg)\psi_{n-1}(x) \implies$


$\displaystyle\Bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2(n+1)}}\Bigg)\Bigg(\displaystyle\frac{e^{-x^{2}/2}}{\sqrt{2^{n}n!\pi^{1/2}}}\Bigg) H_{n+1}(x) = \displaystyle\Bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2(n+1)}}\Bigg)2x\psi_{n}(x) - \displaystyle\Bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2(n+1)}}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{2n}{\sqrt{2n}}\Bigg)\psi_{n-1}(x) \implies$


$$\psi_{n+1}(x) = \displaystyle\Bigg(\sqrt{\frac{2}{n+1}}\Bigg)x\psi_{n}(x) -\Bigg(\sqrt{\frac{n}{n+1}}\Bigg)\psi_{n-1}(x) \quad \mathbf{(7)}$$




## ‚ö°Ô∏èThe Numba Module - Hybrid Solution

We use a hybrid solution with two algorithms for calculating the wave function for calculating a single Fock wave function's values at multiple positions (Single Fock and Multiple Position) (`psi_n_single_fock_multiple_position`). For $n>60$ or more than 35 positions, we use the recurrence for the wave function. For $n\le 60$ and at most 35 positions we use a precomputed matrix with the normalized coefficients of the Hermite polynomial as follows:


$$\psi_{i}(x) = \displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{i}i!\pi^{1/2}}}H_{i}(x)e^{-x^{2}/2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{i}i!\pi^{1/2}}}\mathbf{C_{n}[i]} \cdot  \mathbf{x^{p}} e^{-x^{2}/2} \implies $$


$$\psi_{i}(x) = \mathbf{C^{s}_{n}[i]\cdot x^{p}e^{-x^{2}/2} \quad \mathbf{(8)}}$$


In this equation, $\mathbf{C^{s}_{n}[i]}$ is the row vector of normalized coefficients that multiply each power of $x$ up to $x^n$. The entire matrix $\mathbf{C^s_n}$ of such rows is precomputed up to degree $n=60$[Scott: is that true?].  $\mathbf{x^{p}}$ is a column vector of powers up to n, with zeros in places where the coefficient is zero; for example, for $i=3$, $\mathbf{x^{p}} = [x^{3}, 0.0, x^{1}, 0.0]^T$. This hybrid algorithm is also used in Single Fock and Single Position (`psi_n_single_fock_single_position`) problems, though it offers no computational advantage in these cases. Additionally, there is an argument named **CS_matrix** for these Single Fock functions, set to **True** to enable the use of this matrix. In other words, you can use only the recurrence relation for the wave function at any value. The use of this coefficient matrix is limited to values up to **60** (determined empirically), as beyond this point, the function may encounter precision errors, resulting in incoherent outputs [[10](#-references)].

## ‚ö°Ô∏è The Numba Module - Arguments

For this algorithm to perform as efficiently as possible, Numba's Just-in-Time compilation is used in conjunction with [lru_cache (Least Recently Used - Cache Management)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html). The following arguments were used in the **@nb.jit** decorator:

- **nopython=True:** This argument forces the Numba compiler to operate in "nopython" mode, which means that all the code within the function must be compilable to pure machine code without falling back to the Python interpreter. This results in significant performance improvements by eliminating the overhead of the Python interpreter.
- **looplift=True:** This argument allows Numba to "lift" loops out of "nopython" mode. That is, if there are loops in the code that cannot be compiled in "nopython" mode, Numba will try to move them outside of the compiled part and execute them as normal Python code.
- **nogil=True:** This argument releases the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) while the function is executing. It is useful for allowing the Numba-compiled code to run in parallel with other Python threads, increasing performance in multi-threaded programs.
- **boundscheck=False:** Disables array bounds checking. Normally, Numba checks if array indices are within valid bounds. Disabling this check can increase performance but may result in undefined behavior if there are out-of-bounds accesses.
- **cache=True:** Enables caching of the compiled function. The first time the function is compiled, Numba stores the compiled version in a cache. On subsequent executions, Numba can reuse the compiled version from the cache instead of recompiling the function, reducing the function's startup time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Cython Module

The Cython module includes compiled files for Linux (**.so**) and Windows (**.pyd**), which allows it to be used in Google Colab (Linux). Additionally, this module supports three versions of Python 3: 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. All these files are placed in the package folder upon installation. The source code of the Cython module is available in the repository in **.pyx** format. In the functions of the Cython module, some decorators are used to increase speed:

- **@cython.nogil**: This decorator allows a Cython function to release the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), making it possible to execute that block of code concurrently in multiple threads.
- **@cython.cfunc**:  This decorator tells Cython to treat the function as a C function, meaning it can be called from other Cython or C code, not just Python. The function will have C-level calling conventions.
- **@cython.locals(...)**: Declares local variable types to optimize performance.
- **@cython.boundscheck(False)**: Disables bounds checking for arrays/lists to boost speed, but at the cost of safety.
